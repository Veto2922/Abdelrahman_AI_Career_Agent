## 🌟 Project Highlights & Achievements

- **True Agentic Workflow**: Built with **LangGraph**, the application doesn't just passively answer questions using **Vectorless RAG**; it actively reasons, decides which internal tools to execute, and formats responses based on user context.
- **Microservices-ready Architecture**: Decoupled backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Gradio) connected via internal networking.
- **Advanced Contextual Grounding**: Employs Tree Retrieval mechanisms, ensuring the agent *never* hallucinates skills or projects outside of the formally ingested CV context.
- **Multilingual Support**: Can intelligently converse naturally, including responding contextually in Egyptian Arabic if prompted in Arabic.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Features a highly customized, premium dark-mode Gradio interface injected with custom CSS for an extraordinary user experience.
- **Seamless Deployment**: Fully dockerized using the lightning-fast `uv` package manager and successfully deployed to a high-availability Hugging Face Docker Space.

## 🚀 Live Demo

You can interact with the live agent right now! The application runs securely inside a Docker container orchestrated continuously via Hugging Face.

👉 **[Try the Agent on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Abdelrahman2922/Abdelrahman_AI_Career_Agent)**

*(Clicking the link will take you to the interactive Gradio Chat UI powered by the FastAPI backend).*

## 💻 Local Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+ installed.
- Docker installed (optional, but recommended).
- API Keys for Google GenAI/Langchain/PageIndex appropriately configured.

### Using Docker (Highly Recommended)
Because the project uses Docker and the modern `uv` package manager, reproducing the environment is extremely easy.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Veto2922/Abdelrahman_AI_Career_Agent.git
   cd Abdelrahman_AI_Career_Agent
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Rename `.env.example` to `.env` (or create a new `.env` file) and securely add your keys:
   *Ensure there are NO trailing spaces or quotes around your variables if running with Docker!*
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
   Page_index_api=723f...
   # (Include any LangSmith configs if tracing is to be used)
   ```

3. **Build & Run:**
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t ai-career-agent .
   
   # Run the container (mapping both API and UI ports)
   docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 7860:7860 --env-file .env ai-career-agent
   ```

4. **Access the App:**
   - **Frontend UI:** `http://localhost:7860`
   - **FastAPI Swagger Docs:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Native Local Installation (Without Docker)

1. **Install `uv` (the fast python package installer):**
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **Sync Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv sync --frozen --no-dev
   ```

3. **Run the Apps:**
   You will need to open two terminal windows:
   
   *Terminal 1 (Backend API):*
   ```bash
   uv run uvicorn main_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   
   *Terminal 2 (Frontend App):*
   ```bash
   uv run python gradio_app.py
   ```
